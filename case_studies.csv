possible. This could be coming off the top of the hill, or creating
shelter with a tent or an emergency shelter. Remove and replace any wet clothing and make sure the head is
covered. Protect the casualty from the ground by laying them on a sleeping mat and put in a dry sleeping bag. Ideally, two people should go for help and stay together if you are in a remote area.
